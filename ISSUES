Known issues with MIPL Mobile IPv6 v1.0

Issue 1: HAO placement 

Home Address Destination Option should really be added to a new
destination option header specified in Mobile IPv6 spec which should
be placed after routing header(s), but before fragmentation header.
Putting HAO in DO1 works for now, but support for the new placement
should be added to the IPv6 stack.

Solution: Add support for third DO placement in Linux IPv6 stack.
When: v1.x, maybe.

Issue 2: MH protection with IPSec 

Authentication & authorization of Mobile IPv6 messages between MN and
HA is missing. This will not be supported by the MIPL team in the 2.4
kernels unless someone backports the IPSec in 2.6 kernels to 2.4
kernels. 

Solution: Switch to 2.6 kernel series.

When: v1.x

Issue 3: Mobile Prefix discovery and bootstrapping

Mobile prefix discovery is disabled in MIPL 1.0., since it does not
work properly in the Mobile IPv6 draft version 24 wrt. to
bootstrapping and security.

Solution: Fix mipv6 standard.

When: v1.x, maybe.

Issue 4: Home prefix length is 64 bits.

A prefix length of 64 is always used for home prefix.

Solution: Add extra parameter to rtnetlink message which configures
home address and agent.

When: v1.x
