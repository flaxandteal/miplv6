v. 0.9.5.1 -> v. 1.0

- Support for draft24 / mipv6 proposed standard vs. draft 19 in MIPL 0.9.5.1

- Fully modular architecture. MIPL now consists of CN/HA/MN modules,
which can be dynamically loaded. 

- Moving of home address is now done automatically. See man network-mip6.conf for
details on how this can be used. 

- Handoff occurrs only after duplicate address detection for CoA has finished. 

- MN sends BUs to CNs only after completing its home registration
(receives a BA) first. This should improve handoff performance by
approximately 1s.

- Anycast support is used in HA and anycast addresses are
automatically configured based on HA's own RAs. Multiple HAs can now
exist on same link. See INSTALL for details.

- Configuration of mipv6 information in MN is done via rtnetlink ->
new interface between mipdiag and mipv6 module in kernel. Update
mipdiag and scripts and configuration files!

- Home address is configured to mip6mnha1 device on startup with prefix length 
  128.  

- ICMP prefix discovery is now disabled, since this functionality
in MIPv6 is broken in many ways.

- Added new configuration variable: 
/proc/sys/net/ipv6/mobility/accept_return_routability, which 
controls use of route optimization in CN and MN, default is 1 (on).

- Numerous bugfixes...
